Its a generative model, which is to say, it takes in data, chops it up into a bunch of tiny pieces, then recombines them into something different. Its not actually all  that sophisticated. The ability to do this on a really basic level has been around since atleast the 70's, and has periodically been played with about once a decade ever since. The big barrier to being able to make it do anything actually useful was that performing the math to make the output something you want instead of random garbage took a lot more processing power than was feasible. That processing capability has caught up, so now they can make pretty cool chatter bots and have it create composite images from a bunch of different artist's work that it data-scraped. \n",

      "I'm tending to agree. I'm not a big time investor, but so far I use AI to type out shitty emails and that's about it. Until they start using it to replace Google Ads, I'm not seeing what else it can do that will generate billions of dollars to a business, and I feel like that's just moving from one part of Google/FB to another, not creating something new to buy.  I'm not saying its not impressive, I'm just saying I can't visualize a day where I'm paying for an AI car or an AI house cleaner, AI cell phone, or AI lawyer or AI airline pilot or an AI subscription service of some kind etc. Take a driver for example, yes you could use an AI driver instead of a truck driver, but there are still costs involved with the AI driver, then there's the social costs that the industry has to overcome which is an insane proposition to societies working man/woman. Or an AI chef, it's like, that's already a thing in a way, any fast food feels like it's made by a robot anyway, will it really save the fast food industry that much when you have people willing to work for $10 an hour? I feel like the military applications are a big deal but not creating a whole new industry. I feel like replacing customer support isn't that big of a deal and my experience with any AI customer support always leads to me needing a person. I've never seen anything get so much money poured into something that doesn't really do anything that isn't already conceptualized. To me, amazing unicorns are NEW IDEAS not just new tech. All of the AI stuff out there, I feel like people have already thought of the idea and are trying to make it happen. A humanoid robot would be cool, but that's not a new idea like the iPhone did with having the internet/music/camera/computer/phone/tv all in one device. I never dreamed of something like that until I saw it happen. Nothing has come out of left field yet with AI where your like, wow that's a whole new way of doing something that I've never even imagined let alone thought was even possible. The iPhone, Social Media, Starlink, bitcoin etc. these were all completely new ideas, it wasn't even imagined in science fiction movies. Chat GPT blew me away for a while, but it's already starting to feel like a gimmick to me now in terms of what I really use it for. With all that being said, maybe something will happen where I'm just like damn, we don't need people anymore and AI can do it all, but I'm not there yet and it's hard for me to visualize a world where I wake up and an AI makes me breakfast and I'm walking down the street and there is an AI doing all of the landscaping and then I go to eat and an AI robot takes my order.

Groq GPU does nothing but inferencing, prompting answers to questions and terrible for training. Will LLM models training ever stop? ChatGPT 3.5 has billions of parameters, and ChatGPT 4 has trillions. Every advancement of LLM needs a new training and faster/more energy-saving GPUs. Groq Inference GPU has no use until the model is settle. To get to AGI, no one knows how much training and data feeding LLM will need? I am sure AGI will not stop training because AGI wants to be smarter not like gummy bears.  As to Sora, that demand is even worse. New features as text to image, text to voice & image, text to music, voice & image need training that will never stop just like the black hole.
