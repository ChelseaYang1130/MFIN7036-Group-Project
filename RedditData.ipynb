Its not actually even really AI. Its a generative model, which is to say, it takes in data, chops it up into a bunch of tiny pieces, then recombines them into something different. Its not actually all  that sophisticated. The ability to do this on a really basic level has been around since atleast the 70's, and has periodically been played with about once a decade ever since. The big barrier to being able to make it do anything actually useful was that performing the math to make the output something you want instead of random garbage took a lot more processing power than was feasible. That processing capability has caught up, so now they can make pretty cool chatter bots and have it create composite images from a bunch of different artist's work that it data-scraped. \\n\\nThe hype bros (you guys) then jumped on it based purely off of what it *could* turn into, not *what it can currently do* at present. Manager types are getting excited because they think they'll be able to replace employees with it, finance bros are doing what bullshit-general degree holders do and placing high value on wildly extrapolated capabilities that *might* be possible *some day*. AI can't cure cancer, or pick your stocks perfectly, or self drive a car more safely than humans, or really much of anything yet. \\n\\nPretty much everything these generative models (I'm not going to call them AI, because they aren't)  can do is recombine things that were made by a person.\\n\\nI think that once it becomes apparent that these generative models are just a step on the way to AI and not AI itself and there are some pretty hard limits on what it can do its going to throw cold water on the industry.

Sadly a lot of the criticism here is coming from people that for the life of them can\\'t look past their capitalistic lens. \\n\\nThe profits of AI, as with any other fundamental tech change that has happened over the last two thousand years, could be redistributed among the people that are adversely affected by adoption of the tech, and what we could end up with is a net positive for everyone: a slightly higher profit margin for any businesses using the new tech as well as a higher standard of living/lower living costs/more leisure time for the employee. \\n\\nWhat it requires is government intervention. Absolutely no one should be arguing that a truly deregulated, free market system will provide the best benefit for all parties involved, that is absurd. Look at global CO2 levels and the consequences, look at CoL compared to wage increases over the last 100 years, look at the wealth distribution among the 90% vs the 10% and how that has changed since WW2 as we adopted a more deregulated approach to global trade and finance.\\n\\nIF as Americans we could take a step back from the anti-communist propaganda that we were all fed from our parents and teachers and actually READ what Marx and Engels wrote about what they saw as the end-product of capitalism, it would be extremely apparent that the ROLE OF GOVERNMENT in a capitalistic system is to divert excess profits from capitalists (employers) to cover the externalities incurred by making said profits. Pay for social insurances for those that were taken advantage of while making the profit, pay to mitigate the environmental damage that was incurred, and restrict profit-seeking behavior when it directly conflicts with the public interest.  Just how Joe-six-pack was convinced that government regulation is the reason for their misfortune is impossible for me to grasp, and yet it has happened.\\n\\nI live in Tennessee. It is wild how many people you meet who think \"Murika is the greatest country in the world!\" and yet they are still one month away from not making a payment on their car/house and they put in 40 hours of work per week. Someone is skimming off 75% of the profits of their labor, and just because they weren\\'t lucky enough to have the capital to be the employer instead of employee, they resign themselves to thinking that there\\'s only one viable system, the one they are currently stuck in.\\n\\nA new technology like the implementation of AI has the potential to improve the lives of everyone in the global community. What if we just made it easy, and said that 50% of excess profits from implementation of AI goes back to those businesses/corps that invested in the necessary hardware and software to make it happen. The other 50% was TAXED and used as insurance against all of those people/places that were negatively impacted by adopting AI. There would be a net benefit.

We don\\'t know how the brain works beyond a very basic level. How does a child reach conclusions that contradict what it\\'s taught? No one knows.

All they say and do is determined by the training data and if anything asked is not in there, god knows what will come out. By virtue of being large and complex, these models generalize their training far beyond what we had years ago, but are still very far from generalizing like a human. This is a huge known problem with no solution, so to \"solve\" it they are fed text and data that would take a human 1000 years to process all.
