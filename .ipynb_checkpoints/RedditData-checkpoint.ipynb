The film business is predominately low margin as it is ... even if the democratization of \"premium\" content steals eyeballs and revenue ... the lower production costs could allow for a significant reduction in revenue and keep similar margins.

Not to mention that animated movies have strict style guides for each character and they worlds they live in. I'd say Sora isn't close to being able to follow those style guides consistently across multiple scenes for 2 hours. In a few years it might be able to reduce the amount of time it takes to make an animated movie, which reduces costs in that way, but it'll still take the staff it requires today. They'll just be using AI tools integrated into the tools they're using today. Right now, AI tools work well sometimes, sometimes they don't.

They all have strict language about the use of AI and its only going to become more restrictive every time there are new deals to be negotiated. Every sector of the industry has a union and every union will be protecting its workers. \\n\\nThe issue with licensing the WBD library for AI training is another issue. We know that the stuff AI creates is just a reassembly of everything it has ingested. Well the union deals involve writers, directors and other creatives getting credits and payments when their work is used. So it opens the door for piles and piles of lawsuits and audits. Either way, if they do pull of the licensing, it won't be at a price big enough to move the scale against the massive amount of debt WBD is under. Just like how AI tools decreasing the time it takes to make a movie will save SOME money but won't be a game changer.\\n\\nBest case scenario, a mutual AI relationship allows WBD to crank out more content but that doesn't increase the value of the product. You like HBO because of specific shows, not because of their entire library. \\n\\nAnd on a personal level, we like movies and shows because they touch our soul in some way.

Even if you take a pessimistic view and say it drops \\\\~40 spots, it would still be a top \\\\~5 movie over past 15 years.\\xa0\\n\\nOn Letterboxd, no movie has both higher reviews and number of ratings (([https://letterboxd.com/films/by/rating/)](https://letterboxd.com/films/by/rating/))).\\n\\nBox Office:\\n\\nGlobal opening weekend of \\\\~$180M. WBD predicted a domestic opening of $65M vs. $80M+, close to a +20% beat. Note: these opening figures are studio estimates made on Saturday and are likely higher if you factor in a stronger Sunday due to reviews / word of mouth.\\n\\nFull box office: The only two sequels rated higher than Dune 2 are the The Dark Knight and LOR Twin Towers, which did \\\\~5x their openings weekend in total box office. Which would imply Dune 2 will gross close to $1B, roughly a 30% beat.\\n\\n“The only reason it wasn’t higher is we ran out of seats,” said Rich Gelfond, CEO of IMAX (([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/04/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-march-4.html)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/04/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-march-4.html))).\\n\\nAdditional: I’ve never known anyone that’s gone to see a movie twice in theaters. Know multiple people that are going to see this twice.\\n\\nFuture Movies: Dune 3 has not been greenlit yet, but an announcement from WBD might come soon. In addition, Dune 1 / 2 are based on book #1 out of a series of 6, which leaves the door open for a decade of blockbusters, etc.\\n\\nNow if you’ve read this far, you’re probably thinking “WBD has revenues of \\\\~$40B, how would this make a big impact or be a strong positive catalyst”. On top of distributing the movie, they will also add it to HBO max after theaters… along with a new show, Dune: The Prophecy this fall (([https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10466872/)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10466872/))). It is well known that new shows impact new subscribers, but simply put, there hasn’t been this high caliber of a Movie / show combo since streaming went mainstream. Given this is an entertainment outliner, adding 10-30 million new HBO Max subscribers would not be out of the question, which could translate into upward of \\\\~$6B in HBO subscriber revenue. If the LORs Twin Towers / Empire Strikes Back comparisons hold true, then new subscriber growth could likely be the largest ever seen.', 'score': 3}, {'body': \"WB is in serious trouble in the animation front.
